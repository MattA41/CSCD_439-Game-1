## Know Bugs

- Tower Overlapping:
Players are currently able to place multiple towers on top of each other. This behavior is unintended â€” towers should not overlap. Unfortunately, due to project constraints, this issue could not be fixed in the current version.

- Cons Save/ Load Issue:
When players save their game during a session, the number of coins at that moment is saved correctly. However, loading that save while playing on a different map incorrectly carries over the coins from the previous save. This happens because the save system does not track the map when saving player stats.
